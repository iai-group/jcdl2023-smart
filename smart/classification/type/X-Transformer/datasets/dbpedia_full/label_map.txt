AnatomicalStructure :  entity with a single connected inherent 3D shape that's created by coordinated expression of the organism's own DNA. A frontal eminence (or tuber frontale) refers to one of two rounded elevations on the frontal bone that lie about three centimeters above the supraorbital margin on each side of the frontal suture. Eminences vary in size in different individuals, are occasionally unsymmetrical, and are especially prominent in young skulls. The surface of the bone above them is smooth, and covered by the galea aponeurotica.@enThe diagonal band of Broca is one of the forebrain nuclei that are derived from the ventral telencephalon during development. This structure forms the medial margin of the anterior perforated substance.@enThe perineal raphe is a visible line or ridge of tissue on the human body that extends from the anus through the perineum. It is found in both males and females, and arises from the fusion of the urogenital folds. In males, this structure continues through the midline of the scrotum (scrotal raphe) and upwards through the posterior midline aspect of the penis (penile raphe). It also exists deeper through the scrotum where it is called the scrotal septum. It is the result of a fetal developmental phenomenon whereby the scrotum and penis close toward the midline and fuse.@enAlong the length of the sympathetic trunks are ganglia known as ganglia of sympathetic trunk, sympathetic ganglia or paravertebral ganglia. The ganglia are distinguished as cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral and, except in the neck, they closely correspond in number to the vertebrae.@enIntrafusal muscle fibers are skeletal muscle fibers that serve as specialized sensory organs (proprioceptors) that detect the amount and rate of change in length of a muscle. They constitute the muscle spindle and are innervated by two axons, one sensory and one motor. Intrafusal muscle fibers are walled off from the rest of the muscle by a collagen sheath. This sheath has a spindle or \fusiform\ shape, hence the name \intrafusal.\@enIn human anatomy, the dorsalis pedis artery (dorsal artery of foot), is a blood vessel of the lower limb that carries oxygenated blood to the dorsal surface of the foot. It arises at the anterior aspect of the ankle joint and is a continuation of the anterior tibial artery.

The upper fossae are separated from the lower fossae by a groove for the transverse sinuses. At the point of intersection between all four fossae is the internal occipital protuberance.@enThe middle rectal plexus is a nerve plexus which supplies the middle part of the rectum. It is a branch of the inferior hypogastric plexus. The middle rectal plexus used to be referred to by anatomists as Copeland's web, due to its identification by biologist Charles Copeland and the design of his anatomical drawings in the early 20th century.@enThe lateral cord is a division of the brachial plexus.

The other part comes from the medial cord.@enArachnoid granulations (or arachnoid villi) are small protrusions of the arachnoid (the thin second layer covering the brain) through the dura mater (the thick outer layer). They protrude into the venous sinuses of the brain, and allow cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to exit the sub-arachnoid space and enter the blood stream.@enThe dermis or corium is a layer of skin between the epidermis (with which it makes up the cutis) and subcutaneous tissues, that primarily consists of dense irregular connective tissue and cushions the body from stress and strain. It is divided into two layers, the superficial area adjacent to the epidermis called the papillary region and a deep thicker area known as the reticular dermis. The dermis is tightly connected to the epidermis through a basement membrane. Structural components of the dermis are collagen, elastic fibers, and extrafibrillar matrix. It also contains mechanoreceptors that provide the sense of touch and thermoreceptors that provide the sense of heat. In addition, hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, apocrine glands, lymphatic vessels and blood vessels are pr@enThe portion of the dorsal mesentery that attaches to the greater curvature of the stomach, is known as the dorsal mesogastrium.

Artery :   The median sacral artery (or middle sacral artery) is a small vessel that arises posterior to the abdominal aorta and superior to its bifurcation. It descends in the middle line in front of the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebræ, the sacrum and coccyx, ending in the glomus coccygeum (coccygeal gland). Minute branches pass from it, to the posterior surface of the rectum. On the last lumbar vertebra it anastomoses with the lumbar branch of the iliolumbar artery; in front of the sacrum it anastomoses with the lateral sacral arteries, sending offshoots into the anterior sacral foramina.@enThe femoral artery (Latin: arteria femoralis) is a large artery in the thigh and the main arterial supply to the lower limb. It enters the thigh from behind the inguinal ligament as the common femoral artery, a continuation of the external iliac artery. Here, it lies midway between the anterior superior iliac spine and the symphysis pubis. The common femoral artery gives off the profunda femoris artery and becomes the superficial femoral artery to descend along the anteromedial part of the thigh in the femoral triangle. It enters and passes through the adductor (subsartorial) canal, and becomes the popliteal artery as it passes through an opening in adductor magnus near the junction of the middle and distal thirds of the thigh.@enEsophageal (Oesophageal in British English) arteries are a group of arteries from disparate sources supplying the esophagus. The blood supply to the esophagus can roughly be divided into thirds, with anastamoses between each area of supply.

In some people, the atrioventricular node instead receives blood from the circumflex branch of the left coronary artery, otherwise known as the left circumflex coronary artery or LCX. Very rarely, in approximately 2% of people, the vascular supply to the atrioventricular node arises from both the right coronary artery and the left circumflex branch.@enThe dorsal carpal branch of the ulnar artery arises from the ulnar artery immediately above the pisiform bone, and winds backward beneath the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris; it passes across the dorsal surface of the carpus beneath the extensor tendons, to anastomose with a corresponding branch of the radial artery. Immediately after its origin, it gives off a small branch, which runs along the ulnar side of the fifth metacarpal bone, and supplies the ulnar side of the dorsal surface of the little finger.@enThe tubal branches of ovarian artery are arteries providing blood to the Fallopian tube.

Toward the ileocolic junction, secondary and tertiary loops are observed, the vessels are smaller and become obscured by numerous fat-tabs. The diagrams below show the arrangement and variations of the loops of the mesenteric vessels for various segments of the small intestine of average length:@enThe right colic artery arises from about the middle of the concavity of the superior mesenteric artery, or from a stem common to it and the ileocolic. It passes to the right behind the peritoneum, and in front of the right internal spermatic or ovarian vessels, the right ureter and the Psoas major, toward the middle of the ascending colon; sometimes the vessel lies at a higher level, and crosses the descending part of the duodenum and the lower end of the right kidney. These branches form arches, from the convexity of which vessels are distributed to the ascending colon.@en

Brain : In animal anatomy, the rhinencephalon (from the Greek, rhino = \nose\, and enkephalon = \brain\) or smell-brain is a part of the brain involved with olfaction. In the human brain it is rudimentary.@enBrodmann area 35, together with Brodmann area 36, is most frequently referred to as perirhinal cortex.@enThe primary motor cortex (Brodmann area 4) is a brain region that in humans is located in the dorsal portion of the frontal lobe. It is the primary region of the motor system and works in association with other motor areas including premotor cortex, the supplementary motor area, posterior parietal cortex, and several subcortical brain regions, to plan and execute movements. Primary motor cortex is defined anatomically as the region of cortex that contains large neurons known as Betz cells. Betz cells, along with other cortical neurons, send long axons down the spinal cord to synapse onto the interneuron circuitry of the spinal cord and also directly onto the alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord which connect to the muscles.@enBrodmann area 45 (BA45), is part of the frontal cortex in the human brain. Situated on the lateral surface, inferior to BA9 and adjacent to BA46. This area is also known as pars triangularis (of the inferior frontal gyrus). In the human, it occupies the triangular part of inferior frontal gyrus (H) and, surrounding the anterior horizontal limb of lateral sulcus (H), a portion of the orbital part of inferior frontal gyrus (H). Bounded caudally by the anterior ascending limb of lateral sulcus (H), it borders on the insula in the depth of the lateral sulcus.@enAssociation fibers are bundles of axons within the brain that unite different parts of the same cerebral hemisphere. In human neuroanatomy, bundles of axons within the brain, called fibers, can be categorized by their function into association fibers, projection fibers, and commissural fibers. The association fibers unite different parts of the same cerebral hemisphere, and are of two kinds: (1) those connecting adjacent gyri, short association fibers; (2) those passing between more distant parts, long association fibers.@enThe inferior temporal gyrus is placed below the middle temporal gyrus, and is connected behind with the inferior occipital gyrus; it also extends around the infero-lateral border on to the inferior surface of the temporal lobe, where it is limited by the inferior sulcus. This region is one of the higher levels of the ventral stream of visual processing, associated with the representation of complex object features, such as global shape. It may also be involved in face perception, and in the recognition of numbers.@enThe inferior salivatory nucleus is a cluster of neurons in the dorsal part of pons, just above its junction with the medulla. It is the  General visceral efferent (GVE) component of the glossopharyngeal nerve supplying the parasympathetic input to the parotid gland for salivation.@enBrodmann area 11 is one of Brodmann's cytologically defined regions of the brain. It is involved in decision making and processing rewards, planning, encoding new information into long-term memory, and reasoning.@enVestibular cortex is the portion of the cerebrum which responds to input from the vestibular system. The location is not well defined, but some research indicates a right hemisphere dominance. Lesions of the vestibular nucleus impair function. The \temporo-peri-Sylvian vestibular cortex\ (TPSVC) has been proposed as an analog to parietoinsular vestibular cortex found in monkeys.@enThe paraventricular nucleus (PVN, PVA, or PVH) is a neuronal nucleus in the hypothalamus. It contains groups of neurons that can be activated by stressful and/or physiological changes. Many PVN neurons project directly to the posterior pituitary where they release oxytocin or vasopressin into the general circulation. Other PVN neurons control various anterior pituitary functions, while still others directly regulate appetite and autonomic functions in the brainstem and spinal cord.@enThe biventer lobule (or biventral lobule) is a region of the cerebellum. It is triangular in shape; its apex points backward, and is joined by the gray band to the pyramid. The lateral border is separated from the inferior semilunar lobule by the postpyramidal fissure. The base is directed forward, and is on a line with the anterior border of the tonsil, and is separated from the flocculus by the postnodular fissure.@enThe central lobule is a small square lobule, situated in the anterior cerebellar notch.

The falx cerebelli generally lies somewhere between 2.8 and 4.5 cm in length and is approximately 1–2 mm thick.@enThe superior olivary complex (or SOC or superior olive) is a collection of brainstem nuclei that functions in multiple aspects of hearing and is an important component of the ascending and descending auditory pathways of the auditory system. The SOC is intimately related to the trapezoid body: most of the cell groups of the SOC are dorsal (posterior in primates) to this axon bundle while a number of cell groups are embedded in the trapezoid body. Overall, the SOC displays a significant interspecies variation, being largest in bats and rodents and smaller in primates.@enThe cerebrospinal fibers, derived from the cells of the motor area of the cerebral cortex, occupy the middle three-fifths of the base; they are continued partly to the nuclei of the motor cranial nerves, but mainly into the pyramids of the medulla oblongata.@enThe centrum semiovale, semioval center or centrum ovale  is the central area of white matter found underneath the cerebral cortex. The white matter, located in each hemisphere between the cerebral cortex and nuclei, as a whole has a semioval shape. It consists of cortical projection fibers, association fibers and cortical fibers. It continues ventrally as the corona radiata.@enThe falx cerebri is also known as the cerebral falx, named from its sickle-like form. It is a large, crescent-shaped fold of meningeal layer of dura mater that descends vertically in the longitudinal fissure between the cerebral hemispheres. The falx cerebri attaches anteriorly at the crista galli in proximity to the cribriform plate and to the frontal and ethmoid sinuses. Posteriorly, it is connected with the upper surface of the tentorium cerebelli. Its superior margin is attached at midline to internal surface of skull, as far back as the internal occipital protuberance. The superior sagittal sinus is contained in the superior margin of the falx cerebri and overlies the longitudinal fissure of the brain. The inferior sagittal sinus is contained in the inferior margin of the falx cerebri@enThe striatum, also known as the neostriatum or striate nucleus, is a subcortical part of the forebrain and a critical component of the reward system. It receives glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs from different sources and serves as the primary input to the basal ganglia system. In all primates, the dorsal striatum is divided by a white matter tract called the internal capsule into two sectors called the caudate nucleus and the putamen. The ventral striatum is composed of the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle in primates. Functionally, the striatum coordinates multiple aspects of cognition, including motor and action planning, decision-making, motivation, reinforcement, and reward perception.@enThe anterolateral sulcus (or ventrolateral sulcus) is a sulcus on the side of the medulla oblongata. The rootlets of cranial nerve XII (the hypoglossal nerve) emerge from this sulcus.@enBrodmann area 20 is a part of the cerebral cortex of the brain.@enThe anterior lobe of cerebellum is the portion of the cerebellum responsible for mediating unconscious proprioception.

Bopulu was seen by Opportunity rover in 2010 in the distance, and with some of its rim visible. Bopoplu was officially named in 2006 along with 31 Mars craters. Research has indicated that the impact that is thought to have created Bopulu went so deep that it went though existing layers and ejected older material from Mars' Noachian period. Bopulu is a 19 kilometres (12 mi) diameter wide crater south of the Opportunity MER-B landing site, a rover which operated in the region starting in 2004 and therefore resulted in greater exploration and study of craters in this region.

It is 114.1 km in diameter and was named after Pierre Curie, a French physicist-chemist (1859-1906). Impact craters generally have a rim with ejecta around them, in contrast volcanic craters usually do not have a rim or ejecta deposits. As craters get larger (greater than 10 km in diameter) they usually have a central peak. The peak is caused by a rebound of the crater floor following the impact. \n* Curie Crater, as seen by CTX camera (on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter). \n* \n*@enRousillon Rupes is a scarp (rupes is Latin for \cliff\) on the surface of the Uranian moon Titania named after \Bertram, count of Rousillon\ (an Elisabethan English misspelling for Roussillon) in William Shakespeare's comedy All's Well That Ends Well. The 402 km long feature is a normal fault situated near the equator and running perpendicular to it. The scarp cuts impact craters, which probably means that it was formed at a relatively late stage of moon's evolution, when the interior of Titania expanded and its ice crust cracked as a result. Rousillon Rupes has only few crater superimposed on it, which also implies its relatively young age. The scarp was first imaged by Voyager 2 spacecraft in January 1986.@enMa'adim Vallis is one of the largest outflow channels on Mars, about 700 km long and significantly larger than Earth's Grand Canyon. It is over 20 km wide and 2 km deep in some places. It runs from a region of southern lowlands thought to have once contained a large group of lakes (see Eridania Lake) north to Gusev crater near the equator. It looks as if water may have collected in Gusev crater, forming a giant lake; the Spirit Rover was sent there to investigate that possibility, but found only volcanic rocks on the floor of Gusev. Any lake deposits were probably covered over by a later deposit of volcanic materials from Apollinaris Mons, a nearby volcano.@enQi Baishi is a crater on Mercury. It has an asymmetric pattern of ejecta rays, which formed by an object travelling to the east or to the west and impacting Mercury's surface at a very low incidence angle.

It is about 139.7 km in diameter and was named after Henry Norris Russell, an American astronomer (1877-1957). Debris flows have been observed on some of the dunes in this crater. Some researchers believe that they may be caused by liquid water. Liquid water could be stable for short periods of time in the summer in the southern hemisphere of Mars. These gully-like debris flows may be due to small amounts of ice melting. Another idea is that chunks of dry ice form on the dunes during the cold winter, then slide down in the spring when it is warmer. Experiments have demonstrated that carbon dioxide from the thawing dry ice forms a lubricating layer under pieces of dr@en

The grape is believed to have originated between the comune of Prepotto and the Slovenian border where records of the Schiopettino wine being used in marriage ceremonies date to 1282. The grape was nearly lost to extinction following the phylloxera epidemic of the late 19th century when vineyard owners decided against replanting the variety in favor of French wine grapes like Cabernet franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot gris, Sauvignon blanc and Merlot. Some isolated plantings continued to exist till a 1978 European Union decree encouraged its planting in the province of Udine.@enChatus is a red wine grape variety native to Ardèche, France.@enThe Kerner grape is an aromatic white grape variety.

But so far this speculation has yet to be conclusively proven. The grape is highly aromatic with a \grapey\ characteristic reminiscent of Muscat grape varieties. The grape is rarely used for varietal wines because it requires a high level of ripeness to avoid producing wine with a \mousey\ flavor, a coarse texture and overabundance of acidity.@enProkupac is a red Serbian wine grape that is often used to produce darkly colored rosé.

It received varietal protection in 1993.@enBlauer Portugieser is a red Austrian and German wine grape found primarily in the Rheinhessen, Pfalz and wine regions of Lower Austria. It is also one of the permitted grapes in the Hungarian wine Egri Bikavér (Bull's blood). In Germany, the cultivated area covered 4,551 hectares (11,250 acres) or 4.5% of the total vineyard area in 2007. Wine cellars usually vinify a simple light red wine, which is characterized by a fresh, tart and light body. It is also frequently vinified as a rosé. Blauer Portugieser is also very well suited as table grapes, however it is not sold as such because the selling of wine grapes as table grapes is not permitted in the European Union.

It is most widely planted on the left bank of the Tanaro river in the Roero district near Alba, though some plantings exist on the right bank of the Tanaro in the Langhe hills. Recent DNA profiling shows that Favorita is related to the Liguria grapes Pigato and Vermentino, which may support the theory that the grape originated there. Since the late 20th century, plantings of Favorita have been on the decline as Chardonnay and Arneis have increased in popularity among producers on the right and left bank of the Tanaro respectively. Featuring larger berry sizes than most wine grapes, Favorita has been a popular table grape in Piedmont.@enPinotage /ˈpɪnətɑːʒ/ PIN-ə-tahzh is a red wine grape that is South Africa's signature variety. It was bred there in 1925 as a cross between Pinot noir and Cinsaut (Cinsaut was known as \Hermitage\ in South Africa during that time, hence the portmanteau name of Pinotage). It typically produces deep red varietal wines with smoky, bramble and earthy flavors, sometimes with notes of bananas and tropical fruit, but has been criticized for sometimes smelling of acetone. Pinotage is often blended, and also made into fortified wine and even red sparkling wine.
